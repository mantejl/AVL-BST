# AVL-BST

C++ implementation for a function that checks if all leaf nodes in a binary tree are at the same level, 
a binary search tree (BST) using templated classes and an AVL tree implementation as an extension of the binary search tree. 
 Key functionalities include insertion, removal, finding, and clearing of nodes in the BST.
 The AVL tree maintains balance during insertion and removal operations to ensure logarithmic height and efficient search times. The code includes definitions for AVL nodes, AVL tree operations (insert, remove), and various helper functions such as rotation and balancing adjustments. Additionally, there are explicit implementations for node swapping, fixing imbalances after insertion and removal, as well as left and right rotations in the AVL tree. The code emphasizes maintaining the balance property of AVL trees to achieve optimal performance.
